  "evidence": "This database contains financial statement data for a company, spanning Balance Sheet, Income Statement, and Cash Flow Statement. All monetary values are expressed in Vietnamese Dong (VND).\n\n**1. Data Granularity and Time Periods:**\n- For the 'balance_sheet' table:\n    - 'ending_2024_vnd' represents the *snapshot value* of a specific financial item at the end of the fiscal year 2024 (December 31, 2024).\n    - 'beginning_2024_vnd' represents the *snapshot value* of the same item at the beginning of the fiscal year 2024 (January 1, 2024), which is equivalent to the value at the end of fiscal year 2023 (December 31, 2023).\n- For the 'income_statement' and 'cash_flow_statement' tables:\n    - 'year_2024_vnd' represents the *aggregated value* over the entire fiscal year 2024.\n    - 'year_2023_vnd' represents the *aggregated value* over the entire fiscal year 2023.\n- These distinctions are crucial for calculating changes (snapshot difference) versus total performance (period sum).\n\n**2. Core Financial Relationships and Identifiers:**\n- The 'line_item' column in each table ('balance_sheet', 'income_statement', 'cash_flow_statement') serves as a unique textual identifier for each specific financial metric *within that particular statement*.\n- While 'line_item' names can be identical across different statements (e.g., 'profit_before_tax'), they should primarily be interpreted in the context of their specific financial statement.\n- However, for comparative analysis and reconciliation, the following *conceptual links* between line items across different statements are vital:\n    - **Profit Before Tax Consistency:** The 'profit_before_tax' in the 'income_statement' is the same conceptual figure as 'profit_before_tax' in the 'cash_flow_statement', serving as the starting point for the indirect method of cash flow from operations.\n    - **Cash Balance Reconciliation:** The 'cash_and_cash_equivalents' (ending balance) in the 'balance_sheet' for a given year should conceptually reconcile with 'cash_and_cash_equivalents_at_end_of_year' in the 'cash_flow_statement' for the same year. Similarly, 'cash_and_cash_equivalents_at_beginning_of_year' in the 'cash_flow_statement' matches the 'beginning_2024_vnd' (end of 2023) of 'cash_and_cash_equivalents' in the 'balance_sheet'.\n    - **Profit Transfer to Equity:** The 'profit_after_tax' from the 'income_statement' contributes directly to 'undistributed_profit_after_tax_for_the_year' within the 'equity' section of the 'balance_sheet'.\n    - **Non-Controlling Interests:** 'non_controlling_interests' on the 'balance_sheet' reflects the cumulative balance, while 'non_controlling_interests_income_statement' on the 'income_statement' reflects the current period's share of profit/loss attributable to them.\n\n**3. Fundamental Accounting Equations and Relationships:**\n- **The Accounting Equation (Balance Sheet):** `total_assets = total_liabilities_and_equity`. This is always true for the balance sheet.\n- **Asset Structure:** `total_assets = current_assets + non_current_assets`.\n- **Liabilities and Equity Structure:** `total_liabilities_and_equity = liabilities + equity`.\n- **Equity Structure:** `equity = owner_equity + non_controlling_interests`.\n- **Components of Fixed Assets:** `fixed_assets = tangible_fixed_assets + intangible_fixed_assets + investment_properties`.\n    - For individual fixed asset categories (tangible, intangible, investment properties), their net book value is calculated as `original_cost + accumulated_depreciation` (since accumulated depreciation is stored as a negative value in the JSON).\n- **Inventories:** `inventories = inventory_cost + provision_for_inventory_devaluation` (since provision is stored as a negative value).\n- **Receivables (Short-Term Example):** `short_term_receivables = trade_receivables + advances_to_suppliers + other_short_term_receivables + provision_for_doubtful_short_term_receivables` (since provision is stored as a negative value).\n- **Income Statement Flow:** `net_revenue_from_sales_and_services - cost_of_goods_sold_and_services_rendered = gross_profit_from_sales_and_services`.\n- **Overall Profit:** `profit_before_tax = net_operating_profit + profit_from_other_activities`.\n\n**4. Common Financial Calculations and Ratios:**\n- **Net Change (for Balance Sheet items):**\n    `SELECT (ending_2024_vnd - beginning_2024_vnd) AS net_change FROM balance_sheet WHERE line_item = 'desired_item'`\n- **Year-over-Year Growth/Decline (for Income Statement/Cash Flow items):**\n    `SELECT ((year_2024_vnd - year_2023_vnd) * 100.0 / year_2023_vnd) AS growth_percentage FROM income_statement WHERE line_item = 'desired_item'`\n    *Note: Ensure division by non-zero 'year_2023_vnd' to avoid errors. If 'year_2023_vnd' is 0, growth cannot be calculated as a percentage.*\n- **Gross Profit Margin:**\n    `SELECT (T1.year_2024_vnd * 100.0 / T2.year_2024_vnd) AS gross_profit_margin_2024 FROM income_statement AS T1 JOIN income_statement AS T2 ON T1.line_item = 'gross_profit_from_sales_and_services' AND T2.line_item = 'net_revenue_from_sales_and_services'`\n- **Current Ratio:**\n    `SELECT (T1.ending_2024_vnd * 1.0 / T2.ending_2024_vnd) AS current_ratio_2024 FROM balance_sheet AS T1 JOIN balance_sheet AS T2 ON T1.line_item = 'current_assets' AND T2.line_item = 'current_liabilities'`\n- **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:**\n    `SELECT (T1.ending_2024_vnd * 1.0 / T2.ending_2024_vnd) AS debt_to_equity_2024 FROM balance_sheet AS T1 JOIN balance_sheet AS T2 ON T1.line_item = 'liabilities' AND T2.line_item = 'equity'`\n- **Return on Assets (ROA):**\n    `SELECT (T1.year_2024_vnd * 1.0 / ((T2_end.ending_2024_vnd + T2_beg.beginning_2024_vnd) / 2)) AS ROA_2024 FROM income_statement AS T1 JOIN balance_sheet AS T2_end ON T1.line_item = 'profit_after_tax' AND T2_end.line_item = 'total_assets' JOIN balance_sheet AS T2_beg ON T2_beg.line_item = 'total_assets'`\n    *Note: For ROA, average total assets over the period (beginning + ending / 2) is commonly used.*\n\n**5. Handling of Values and Parentheses Convention**:\nAll numerical values should be extracted as integers. Pay close attention to the sign of the numbers. In standard financial reporting, certain items (e.g., cash outflows, accumulated depreciation, provisions for doubtful debts/inventory devaluation, expenses) are often presented as negative values or within parentheses in the source PDF (e.g., `(1,000,000)`). When extracting, convert values presented in parentheses into negative numbers in the JSON output (e.g., `-1000000`). For example, `net_cash_flow_from_financing_activities` will often be a negative number if the company is repaying debt or paying dividends. Similarly, `basic_earnings_per_share` can be negative if the company reports a net loss.\n\n**6. Querying Best Practices for LLM**:\n- When a user asks for \"change\" or \"growth\" for balance sheet items, imply a comparison between 'ending_2024_vnd' and 'beginning_2024_vnd'.\n- When a user asks for \"change\" or \"growth\" for income statement or cash flow statement items, imply a comparison between 'year_2024_vnd' and 'year_2023_vnd'.\n- Pay close attention to specific year references (e.g., \"for 2024\", \"at the end of 2023\"). The 'beginning_2024_vnd' in the balance sheet is equivalent to the 'end of 2023'.\n- If a query involves abstract financial concepts like \"assets\", \"liabilities\", \"revenue\", or \"profit\", interpret them by referring to the most appropriate 'line_item' from the respective tables. For instance, \"total assets\" refers to 'total_assets' in 'balance_sheet'.\n- When calculating ratios, ensure the correct 'line_item' from the correct table is used, and apply appropriate mathematical operations (e.g., division, multiplication for percentages).\n- Be mindful of potential division by zero when calculating percentages or ratios and handle them gracefully.\n- Be particularly careful with the sign of the numbers when performing calculations involving contra-accounts (e.g., accumulated depreciation, provisions), as they are stored as negative values in the JSON.\n- Do not omit any critical information required to generate high-quality SQL.",
